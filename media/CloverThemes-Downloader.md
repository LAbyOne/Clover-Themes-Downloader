# CloverThemes Downloader


Due to the huge amount of themes present on the Clover repository,

The available themes list has been reduced in order to keep a less confusing experience while using this tool.

And also splitted between CloverHackyColor and badruzeus menus.

The remaining unlisted files can however be downloaded by accessing the menu screenshots and then writing or copy/pasting the name into the prompt.
